    "Because the pre-built Windows libraries available for OpenCV 4.5.0 do not include the CUDA modules, or support for the Nvidia Video Codec SDK, Nvidia cuDNN, Intel Media SDK or Intelâ€™s Math Kernel Libraries (MKL) or Intel Threaded Building Blocks (TBB) performance libraries, I have included the build instructions, below for anyone who is interested. If you just need the Windows libraries then go to Download OpenCV 4.5.0 with CUDA 11.1. To get an indication of the performance boost from calling the OpenCV CUDA functions with these libraries see the OpenCV 3.4 GPU CUDA Performance Comparisson (nvidia vs intel).\n",

    "The guide below details instructions on compiling the 64 bit version of OpenCV 4.5.0 shared libraries with Visual Studio 2019, CUDA 11.1, and optionally the Nvidia Video Codec SDK, Nvidia cuDNN, Intel Media SDK, Intel Math Kernel Libraries (MKL), Intel Threaded Building Blocks (TBB) and Python bindings for accessing OpenCV CUDA modules from within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main topics covered are given below. Although most of the sections can be read in isolation I recommend reading the pre-build checklist first to check whether you will benefit from and/or need to compile OpenCV with CUDA support."
