This means that any programs linked against the resulting opencv_world450.dll shared library should work on all GPU's currently supported by CUDA 11.1 and all GPU's released in the future. As mentioned above this comes at a cost, both in terms of compilation time and shared library size. Before discussing the CMake settings which can be used to reduce these costs we need to understand the following concepts:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    " \t<li><strong>Compute-capability</strong> - every GPU has a fixed compute-capability which determines its general specifications and features. In general the more recent the GPU the higher the compute-capability and the more features it will support. This is important because:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    " \t<li>Each version of CUDA supports different compute-capabilities. Usually a new version of CUDA comes out to suppoort a new GPU architecture, in the case of CUDA 11.0, support was added for the Ampere (compute 8.0, with compute 8.6 added in CUDA 11.1) architecture. On the flip side support for compute 3.0 and 3.2 was dropped. Therefore by choosing to build OpenCv with CUDA 11.1 we have limited ourselves to GPU's of compute-capability &gt;=3.5. Notice we have not limited ourselves to compute-capability GPU's &lt;=8.6, the reason for this is discussed in the next section.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>You can build opencv_world450.dll to support one or many different compute-capabilities, depending on your specific requirements.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    " \t<li><strong>Supporting a compute-capability</strong> - to support a specific compute-capability you can do either of the following, or a combination of the two:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    " \t<li>Generate architecture-specific cubin files, which are only <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/turing-compatibility-guide/index.html#application-compatibility-on-turing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forward-compatible</a> with GPU architectures with the same major version number. This can be controlled by passing CUDA_ARCH_BIN to CMake. For example passing -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=3.0 to CMake, will result in opencv_world450.dll containing binary code which can only run on compute-capability 3.0, 3.5 and 3.7 devices. Futhermore it will not support any specific features of compute-capability 3.5 (e.g. dynamic parallelism) or 3.7 (e.g. 128 K 32 bit registers). In the case of OpenCV 4.4.0 this will not restrict any functionality of the standard CUDA functions on compute capability 3.5 and 3.7 devices, because they only uses features from compute-capability 3.0 and below. This can be confirmed by a quick search of the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencv/opencv/search?q=__CUDA_ARCH__&amp;unscoped_q=__CUDA_ARCH__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">main</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/search?q=__CUDA_ARCH__&amp;unscoped_q=__CUDA_ARCH__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contrib</a> repositories for the __CUDA_ARCH__ flag.</li>\n",

This can be controlled by passing CUDA_ARCH_PTX to CMake. For example by passing -DCUDA_ARCH_PTX=8.6 to CMake, the opencv_world450.dll will contain PTX code for compute-capability 8.6 which can be Just In Time (JIT) compiled to architecture-specific binary code by the CUDA driver, on any future GPU architectures. Because of the default CMake rules when CUDA_ARCH_BIN is not explicitly set it will also contain architecture-specific cubin files for GPU architectures 3.5-8.6.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    " \t<li><strong>PTX considerations</strong> - given that PTX code is forward-compatible and cubin binaries are not it would be tempting to only include the former. To understand why this might not be such a great idea, a things to be aware of when generating PTX code:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    " \t<li>As mentioned previously the CUDA driver JIT compiles PTX code at run time and cache's the resulting cubin files so that the compile operation should in theory be a one-time delay, at least until the driver is updated. However if the cache is not large enough JIT compilation will happen <strong>every time</strong>, causing delay every time your program executes.To get an idea of this delay I passed -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=3.5 and -DCUDA_ARCH_PTX=3.5 to CMake before building OpenCV. I then emptied the cache (default location %appdata%\\NVIDIA\\ComputeCache\\) and ran the GEMM <a href=\"#cuda_performance\">performance example</a> on a GTX 1060 (compute-capability 6.1), to force JIT compilation. I measured an initial delay of <strong>over 3 minutes</strong> as the PTX code was JIT compiled before the program started to execute. Following that, the delay of subsequent executions was around a minute, because the default cache size (256 MB) was not large enough to store all the compiled PTX code. Given my compile options the only solution to remove this delay is to increase the size of the cache by setting the <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CUDA_CACHE_MAXSIZE</a> environmental variable to a number of bytes greater than required. Unfortunately because, \"Older binary codes are evicted from the cache to make room for newer binary codes if needed\", this is more of a band aid than a solution. This is because the maximum cache size is 4 GB, therefore your PTX compiled code can be evicted at any point in time if other programs on your machine are also JIT compiling from PTX, bringing back the \"one-time\" only delay.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>For maximum device coverage you should include PTX for the lowest possible GPU architecture you want to support.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>For maximum performance <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#just-in-time-compilation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NVIDIA</a> recommends including PTX for the highest possible architecture you can.</li>\n",

    " \t<li>Firstly stick with the defaults if compile time and shared library size are not an issue. This offers the greatest amount of flexibility from a development standpoint, avoiding the possibility of needing to recompile OpenCV when you switch GPU.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>If your programs will always be run on your main GPU, just pass -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=6.1 to CMake to target your architecture only. It should take around an hour to build, depending on your CPU and the resulting shared library should not be larger than 200 MB.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>If you are going to deploy your application, but only to newer GPU's pass -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=6.1,7.0,8.0,8.6 and -DCUDA_ARCH_PTX=8.6 to CMake for maximum performance and future compatibility.This is advisable because you may not have any control over the size of the JIT cache on the target machine, therefore including cubin's for all compute-capabilities you want to support, is the only way be sure to prevent JIT compilation delay on every invocation of your application.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>If size is really an issue but you don't know which GPU's you want to run your application on then to ensure that your program will run on all current and future supported GPU's pass -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=6.1 and -DCUDA_ARCH_PTX=3.0 to CMake for maximum coverage.</li>\n",
